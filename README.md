# voter_registration
 The application will prompt the user for their first name, last name, age, country of citizenship, state of residence and zipcode. To be a valid registration all fields must be entered. If they are at least 18 years old and a U.S citizen, they can move forward and be prompted for the remaining questions and register to vote. If not, they should not be presented with the additional questions. There should be some error checking logic on the input statements to make sure the age numbers entered seem reasonable (e.g. a person is probably not > 120 years) and states should be 2 letters representing only valid U.S. States.
